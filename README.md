# SpiritX_Semi_Colon_01
Implementation of SecureConnect, a secure and user-friendly authentication system!
.

## 🚀 Guidelines for Stage 1
Outline the requirements or objectives for the first stage of development.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed before running the project:
- **Node.js**  
- **Docker** (Ensure Docker Engine is running)  
- **Database** (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)  
- Any other required packages  

## 📥 Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

## ⚙️ Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```sh
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Configure environment variables (create a `.env` file and set necessary values):
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
   PORT=5000
   ```
4. Run the backend server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
   or for development:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## 🎨 Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```sh
   cd ../frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the frontend server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

## 🐳 Ensure Docker Engine is Running
Before running the project, make sure **Docker Engine** is running in the background.

## 🗄️ Database Setup and Configuration
### 📌 Using a Database Dump (Recommended)
1. Import the database dump file:
   ```sh
   mysql -u your_user -p your_database < database_dump.sql
   ```
2. Ensure the database connection settings in `.env` match your database configuration.

### 🏗️ Manual Setup
1. Create a new database in your preferred database management system.
2. Run the migration scripts or manually set up the required tables and relations.
3. Ensure the connection details match those in the `.env` file.

## 🤔 Assumptions Made During Development
- The backend API assumes authentication using JWT.
- The frontend fetches data from `http://localhost:5000/api` by default.
- Users must have **Docker installed and running** for an easy setup.

## ✨ Additional Features Implemented
- **🐳 Dockerization**: The project can be run using Docker for easier deployment.
  - Build and run using:
    ```sh
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
- **🔄 CI/CD Integration**: Automated tests and deployment setup.
- **🔧 Environment Configurations**: Separate configurations for development and production.
